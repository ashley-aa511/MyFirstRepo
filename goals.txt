"My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year"

My goals include applying to masters scholarships abroad. I also intend to complete the pathway program and gain impactful knowledge to help further my studies.
I am applying also to tech companies like google and microsoft for tech careers like software engineering and data analysis. This is because with my background in Backend Engineering and Data Analyst , I beleive this interdisciplinary approach plus my degree opens more opportunities for me. I intend to be discipline and resilience.
I am learning to communicate more often as it is one of my dreams to be a speaker. As Vin Ging said "you are only as good as you can communicate " and being able to talk effectively and share my ideas will help me reach global investors or top leaders who can vouch for me to be an employee in organizations I intend to work in.
