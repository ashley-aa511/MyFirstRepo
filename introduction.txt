Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Ashley Awuor. I am 23 years old and currently reside in Kenya. I recently graduated from Moi universiity with a Bachelors Degree in Economics and a certificate in Software Engineering from ALX Africa. This interdiscplinary take opened opportunities for me through buliding projects such as the SDG dashboard that outlines Kenya's progress in SDGs. Apart from building the projects it has given me insight in doing research in Decent and Economic growth by applying and pursuing Masters programs.
Currently I am pursuing the ALX Pathway program that has really benefited my understanding and knowledge in initiating problem statements as it is a foundation of doing research at a higher program. Outside education I love hiking, and while in high school I got to be a part of Presidential Awards Club where we would go for hikes in Kerio Valley and witness the goodness of nature and how it refreshed my mind. I got to meet beautiful communities who embrace their culture and live in the awareness of what nature provides for them. It is one of the memories that I hold on to because I got to live my life outside the daily schedue I set for myself and I even met new friends who opened my mind to new information. 
Lastly, I belive I am destined to be great and one of the greats and I will leave a comment for my future self, "slow is the fastest possible way to reach your goals, the top of a mountain is the bottom of another, so enjoy life in the present and DO HARD THINGS"
